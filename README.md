# How it works
I put the album information in the variable including title and image in the form of object in array. And I used concat function to duplicate the cardeck and used forEach function to put each of cards on the board. First pick and second pick have their dataset title, and if the titles are matched they go through the matched function to add match class to make the pair opaque.
